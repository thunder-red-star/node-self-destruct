(translated from legalese)

If you're a big or small company and want to use this free project to earn money, you can't. It goes against the terms of the
license. If you want to use this project in your company's project, feel free to hire me as an intern, and I can help
customize this to your liking ;)

Fork and edit as necessary, obviously abiding by the first paragraph. But keep the license, and don't advertise it without
my consent. Link back to the main package when you're finished editing.

I'm not providing any guarantees about the stability or integrity of this package. If I decide to put malware in it (cough
cough RIAEvangelist), just know here and now that IT IS NOT MY PROBLEM and YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUE FOR DAMAGES because
when you imported the package you agreed to the terms of the license, whether you read it or not.
